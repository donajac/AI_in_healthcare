# AI in healthcare
Artificial Intelligence increases the ability of healthcare professionals to better understand the day to day patterns and the need of the patients they care for, for better feedback, guidance and accurate diagnosis. It also helps increase the accessibility of better healthcare to people and bridges the gap
between patients and proper healthcare . 
These solutions are aimed strictly for medical professionals that makes diagnosis and
prognosis of medical conditions more accurate and less tedious for healthcare professionals by automating the work they do now. The diagnosis part of the appcontains 2 seperate functionalities. Here we have the detection of tumors on
MRI scans using the U-Net Deep Convolutional Network and the detection of anomalies in Chest X-Rays using the CheXNet Deep Convolutional Network.

1.Anomaly Detection in Chest X-Rays using ChexNet.

Accurate detection of anomalies present in chest X-Rays is
vital for disease detection. Manual detection of these conditions by a radiologist could be tiresome and error-prone. Here we introduce a programmable aid which can detect the presence of 14 conditions:Pleural thickening,pneumothorax,Atelectasis, effusion, cardiomegaly, pneumonia, infiltration, mass,
nodule, Fibrosis, Consolidation, Hernia, Edema, Emphysema.

2.Detection of tumors from MRI using U-Net
Unlike X-rays and CT scans, Magnetic resonance imaging do not use radiation and therefore is considered a noninvasive procedure. Detecting tumors manually by a radiologist is tedious and error prone. Here we introduce a
multi-class segmentation model that is dependable and aids in identifying 3
different abnormalities in each image : edema, enhancing and non enhancing tumours
